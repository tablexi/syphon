TODO
--------------------------------
- add scope tests
- add test (super controller namespace shouldn't change, it should be hardcoded
  as soon as the method is called in the dsl)
- add tests to module namespace generator
- all model proxy action methods should return the actual object so respond_with
  knows what HTTP code / content to put in the response body
